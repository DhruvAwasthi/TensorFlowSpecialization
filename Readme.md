# TensorFlow in Practice Specialization by Instructor Laurence Moroney offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera

I would like to thank Laurence Moroney for giving us wonderful exposure to discover the tools software developers use to build scalable AI-powered algorithms in TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework.

This repository contains the solution of all the weekly quizzes and programming assignments of all four courses in TensorFlow in Practice specialization offered by **deeplearning.ai** on Coursera.

---

The first course is: **Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning**.

After completing this first course in the specialization, now I
- Know best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework
- Can build a basic neural network in TensorFlow
- Can train a neural network for a computer vision application
- Understand how to use convolutions to improve your neural network.

---

The second course is: **Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow**.
After completing this second course in the specialization, now I can
- Handle real-world image data
- Plot loss and accuracy
- Explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout
- Do transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.

---

The third course is: **Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow**.
After completing this third course in the specialization, now I can
- Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow
- Process text, including tokenization and representing sentences as vectors
- Apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs in TensorFlow
- Train LSTMs on existing text to create original poetry and more.

---

The fourth course is: **Sequences, Time Series and Prediction**.
After completing this fourth and final course in the specialization, now I can
- Solve time series and forecasting problems in TensorFlow
- Prepare data for time series learning using best practices
- Explore how RNNs and ConvNets can be used for predictions
- Build a sunspot prediction model using real-world data.
